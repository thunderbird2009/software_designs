### **2.3. Task and Execution Subsystem (including Workflow)** üöÄ‚öôÔ∏è

  * **Purpose:** Orchestrates the execution of annotation tasks, manages individual data units and judgments, runs workflows, applies quality control, and performs results aggregation.
  * **Owned Data Entities:** `Units`, `Judgments / Annotations`, `WorkflowDefinitions`, `WorkflowSteps`, `WorkflowRoutes`, `WorkflowRules`, `UnitWorkflowStates`.
  * **Key Behaviors:**
      * Unit creation based on DataSources.
      * Receiving, storing, and managing Judgments.
      * Managing Unit state (standalone or via `UnitWorkflowStates`).
      * CRUD operations for workflow definitions.
      * Executing workflow logic: evaluating rules, routing units, managing step transitions via `UnitWorkflowStates`.
      * Applying QC rules (tainting judgments based on Test Question results).
      * Running aggregation/consensus algorithms.
      * Publishing/consuming internal events for coordination.

      * Validates annotation input against CML rules.
      * Formats annotation data into JSON for submission.
      * May perform media pre-processing.

  * **Owned Data Entities:** `Contributors`, `Channels`.
  * **Key Behaviors:**
      * CRUD operations for Contributors and Channels.
      * Calculating and updating performance metrics based on judgments.

### **2.6. Architectural Pattern: API Gateway as Orchestrator**

A key architectural pattern used throughout this design is the role of the **API Gateway**. In this system, the gateway is intentionally "overloaded" to serve a dual purpose:

1.  **Conventional Gateway:** It handles standard gateway responsibilities such as request routing, authentication/authorization, rate limiting, and SSL termination.
2.  **Orchestrator / Aggregator:** For many client-facing operations, the API Gateway acts as an orchestrator. It receives a single high-level request from the client (e.g., "Launch Job" or "Request a microtask") and translates it into a sequence of calls to multiple internal subsystems. It then aggregates the responses before sending a single, coherent response back to the client.

This pattern simplifies the frontend application, as it doesn't need to know about the internal microservice architecture. The orchestration logic is centralized in the gateway, making the client's interaction with the backend much cleaner.

## **3. Subsystem Interactions from Use Cases**

### **Use Case 1: User Creates and Launches a Basic Annotation Job**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User/Frontend
    participant API Gateway
    participant ClientMgmt
    participant JobLifecycleMgmt
    participant TaskExec as "Task & Execution System"
    participant ContribMgmt
    participant EventBus

    User/Frontend->>API Gateway: Define Job & Launch
    API Gateway->>ClientMgmt: Validate Auth/Permissions
    ClientMgmt-->>API Gateway: Auth OK
    
    API Gateway->>JobLifecycleMgmt: Create Ontology, DataSource, Job
    JobLifecycleMgmt-->>API Gateway: Return IDs
    
    API Gateway->>JobLifecycleMgmt: Set Job Status: "Running"
    JobLifecycleMgmt-->>API Gateway: Status Updated OK
    API Gateway-->>User/Frontend: Job Launched Successfully

    JobLifecycleMgmt->>EventBus: Publish JobStatusChanged(job_id, "Running")

    activate TaskExec
    TaskExec->>EventBus: Consume JobStatusChanged
    TaskExec->>JobLifecycleMgmt: Get Job & Data Source Details
    JobLifecycleMgmt-->>TaskExec: Return Details
    note over TaskExec: Create Unit records, set state to 'Judgable'
    
    loop For Each New Unit
        TaskExec->>EventBus: Publish UnitReadyForAssignment(unit_id, job_id)
    end
    deactivate TaskExec

    activate ContribM
    ContribM->>EventBus: Consume UnitReadyForAssignment
    note over ContribM: Make task available to eligible contributors
    deactivate ContribM
```

### **Use Case 2: Contributor Finds and Completes a Microtask**

This use case describes the end-to-end flow of a contributor finding an available task, completing the annotation, and submitting the result, including the subsequent quality feedback loops.

**Sequence of Events:**

1.  **Find & Claim Task:** The contributor finds an available `Job Step` and claims a single `Unit` (microtask) to work on, as described in the diagram flow.
2.  **Render Annotation Tool:** The `Annotation Tools` backend prepares a UI data package, which is used by a JavaScript component to render the interactive tool in the contributor's browser.
3.  **Submit Judgment:** The contributor completes the task and submits their annotation (judgment).
4.  **Initial Processing (Task & Execution System):**
    *   `POST /units/{unit_id}/judgments` is called.
    *   The system receives and stores the judgment.
    *   It then immediately checks if the `Unit` was a pre-defined **Test Question**.
5.  **Event Publishing & Quality Feedback (Two Paths):**
    *   **Path A: If it was a Test Question:**
        *   The system publishes a `TestJudgmentEvent` with a payload like `{ judgment_id, was_correct }`.
        *   The **Contributor Management** system consumes this event to provide **immediate feedback** and update the contributor's short-term accuracy metrics.
    *   **Path B: If it was a Regular Unit:**
        *   The system checks if the unit now has enough judgments to be finalized.
        *   If so, it runs an aggregation/consensus algorithm to determine the final "correct" answer.
        *   It then publishes a `UnitFinalized` event with a rich payload like `{ unit_id, final_result, judgments_quality: [...] }`.
        *   The **Contributor Management** system consumes this event to perform a **nuanced, long-term update** to the contributor's trust score based on their agreement with the consensus.

**Outcome:** The contributor submits a microtask. The system provides fast, direct feedback for test questions and slower, more comprehensive quality feedback for regular work, leading to a robust and fair contributor quality model.
